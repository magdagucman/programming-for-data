    "# A Look at Global Health: Suicides - Can We Predict & Therefore Prevent Them?\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Suicide rates vary internationally. Using records taken from UN online databases, this notebook will investigate how well the number of suicides can be predicted by various other factors: unemployment, poverty, inequality, accessibility of psychiatrists, and accessibility of psychiatric hospitals. It will also investigate whether higher gender inequality can be connected with higher percentage of suicides among women.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook will investigate and report on various correlations, as well as present a multidimensional linear regression model (see 'Hypotheses' section for details). The aim is to tell a story about complex causality of suicides and to raise the topic of suicide prevention needing to be focused on satisfying basic human needs as well as providing access to (ideally free) mental healthcare.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "H1: There is a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total number of suicides and unemployment, measured as a total percentage of labour force.\n",
    "\n",
    "H2: There is a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total number of suicides and poverty, measured by percentage of population living below national income poverty line.\n",
    "\n",
    "H3: There is a positive, statistically significant correlation between the total number of suicides and inequality, measured by the Coefficient of Human Inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "H4: There is a negative, statistically significant correlation between the total number of suicides and accessibility of psychiatrists, measured by the number of psychiatrists working in mental health sector per 100000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "H5: There is a negative, statistically significant correlation between the total number of suicides and accessibility of mental hospitals, measured by the number of mental hospitals per 100000 people.\n",
    "\n",
    "H6: There is a positive, statistically significant relation between the ratio of female to male suicides and gender inequality index.\n",
    "\n",
    "H7: Total suicide rates can be predicted by unemployment (measured as a total percentage of labour force), poverty (measured by percentage of population living below national income poverty line), inequality (measured by the Coefficient of Human Inequality), accessibility of psychiatrists (measured by the number of psychiatrists working in mental health sector per 100000 people), accessibility of psychiatric hospitals (measured by the number of mental hospitals per 100000 people).\n",

    "## Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "* describe the data: investigate the data displaying info, summary statistics, head and tail\n",
    "* prepare for analysis: clean and wrangle; create one data set including the following columns: Country, Suicide_male, Suicide_female, Suicide_ratio, Suicide_total, Unemployment, Poverty, Inequality, Psychiatrists_access, Mental_hospitals_access, Gender_inequality_index\n",
    "* sort by total suicide rate and visually look at the first and last 10 rows of data\n",
    "* check for normality of data and other assumptions; remove outliers\n",
    "* use linear regression to show correlations as listed in hypotheses H1-H6; visualise results\n",
    "* use multiple linear regression to investigate relations between total suicide rates and other variables (as per H7): what variables significantly predict suicide rates?; how well does the model account for the variance in suicide rates between the countries?; how does the slope for each significant variable explain the impact on the IV?; visualise results\n",
    "* summarise all results textually\n",
    "* write conclusions; consider bias and other issues\n",
